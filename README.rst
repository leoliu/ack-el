 Emacs Interface to command-line tool ack
==========================================
 
From http://betterthangrep.com/

    ack is a tool like grep, designed for programmers with large trees of
    heterogeneous source code.

    ack is written purely in Perl, and takes advantage of the power of
    Perl's regular expressions.

Feature requests and bug reports are welcome. Thanks.

Install
=======

Place ``ack.el`` in the load-path and put ``(require 'ack)`` or
``(autoload 'ack "ack" nil t)`` in your ``.emacs``.

Usage
=====

``M-x ack``
